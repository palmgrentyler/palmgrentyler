### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tyler Palmgren, and I'm a Mechatronics and Metrology Engineer at ATT Metrology Solutions. 
I'm currently working on earning my C++ certification through UW. I'm hoping to gain a more professional understanding of the language since my main experience with it is through more surface-level high school and college classes.
I'm also hoping to learn a lot more about automation-focused programming to enhance my skills at work, and expand them to other languages.
